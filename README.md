# MircRoPG
A simple roguelike. Has bugs but you can win just kill all the monsters. Shops where being added when I last worked on this and that is broken so you might find a shop room with a guy that if you touch him he dies. 

E = open play equptment screen.
	-> use up/down to select
	-> use right to confirme
	-> use left to go back

I/J/K/L = moves the camera

G = grab this lets you view items from the ground and pick the up. as well as use some times

C = charactor sheet. Only stats that matter are HP, STR(good with sword), DEX(good with axe), DEF

N = Restart game. Only works if player is dead. I don't alway get this far.

numpad = movement

up/down/left/right = movement

space = idk changes Spacepressed to true? the way i use to set these up they would just cout there value so this might do something.




O = some kind of debug key i think. i don't remeber
